This is the Finger Lakes address that puts you close to everything while maintaining that peaceful, away-from-it-all feeling.

While we (Jason and Kristen) split our time between State College, PA and the Finger Lakes, we've built an excellent local support team to ensure you have everything you need. Check-in and check-out are completely automated for your convenience — no coordinating schedules or awkward key exchanges. 

We're always just a message away and can resolve 99% of any issues remotely within the hour. For anything requiring on-site attention, our trusted local team can be there quickly. We believe in being responsive without being intrusive — we're here when you need us, invisible when you don't.

Our goal is simple: provide the perfect balance of helpful hospitality and total privacy. Whether you need a dinner recommendation, have a question about the coffee maker, or just want to share a gorgeous sunset photo from the porch, we love hearing from our guests. Most guests tell us they appreciate our quick responses and local insider knowledge, while still enjoying complete independence during their stay.

## OTHER THINGS TO NOTE

**The Barn's Character:** This is an authentic 1920s barn conversion with original architectural details. You'll find charming quirks like original wood beams, restored barn windows, and gentle creaks that tell its 100-year story. We've modernized everything that matters while preserving the character you came here for.

**Climate Control:** The barn stays naturally cool throughout the day thanks to mature shade trees surrounding the property. Window AC units in the loft and bedrooms provide additional cooling when needed. For heating, we've preserved the original antique radiators — they take a bit longer to warm up but provide wonderful, even heat that's perfect for cozy winter stays.

**Original Floors:** The barn's original wood floors have been lovingly restored and tell a century of stories. You'll notice their authentic character — gentle slopes, historic wear patterns, and the occasional charming creak that reminds you you're staying somewhere truly special.

**Parking:** Private driveway with space for 2-3 vehicles. In winter, we keep the drive plowed and salted.

**Rural Serenity:** You might wake to birdsong, see deer crossing the property at dusk, or hear the occasional tractor passing by. The village is quiet after 9 PM — perfect for stargazing from the fire pit.

**Stairs:** The barn has stairs to the second floor bedrooms. While they're safe and sturdy, they're steeper than modern construction (historic barn style). Not suitable for guests with mobility limitations.

**Digital Guidebook:** We provide a comprehensive digital guide with house instructions, local recommendations, and our favorite hidden gems — all accessible through the booking app.

**Trash & Recycling:** Pickup is Wednesday mornings. Roll bins to the end of the driveway Tuesday night (we'll remind you!).

**Security:** Keyless entry with unique codes for each guest. Ring doorbell for your peace of mind. Very safe, quiet neighborhood where neighbors look out for each other.

**Pet-Friendly:** We love dogs! Just let us know you're bringing your furry friend. Our own Bernedoodle Doug has tested all the best local walking spots. Small pet fee applies.

**Seasonal Notes:** 
- Spring/Summer: Enjoy the screened porch and outdoor spaces
- Fall: Prime leaf-peeping and wine harvest season (book early!)
- Winter: Cozy up by the fire pit, magical holiday lights in the village

**Lightning-Fast Internet:** 400+ Mbps fiber connection — we've both worked remotely from here without a single Zoom glitch. Perfect for streaming, remote work, or multiple devices.
